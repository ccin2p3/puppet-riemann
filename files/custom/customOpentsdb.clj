  :tags    A function which, given an event, returns the hash-map for the tags.
           opentsdb-tags by default.
  :pool-size  The number of connections to keep open. Default 4.
  :reconnect-interval   How many seconds to wait between attempts to connect.
                        Default 5.
  :claim-timeout        How many seconds to wait for a opentsdb connection from
